        <h3> ABOUT ME</h3>
        <div class="aboutMeText">
            <p>Hi there! üëãüèª <br> 
            I'm Lauren!</p>
            <p> I started out my career working as an insurance Claim Specialist where I handle various financial lines claims in the areas of Employment Law, Errors & Ommissions, Crime and Cyber. As great as it was to work in that industry, I knew that there was something missing.<br/><br/>

                I've always had an interest in a variety of creative pursuits, and was craving that creativity in my work life. This is what brought me to Juno College! From the moment I printed my first "Hello World" on the page, I was hooked. (...)<br/><br/>

                I have a good eye for colour (and love working with it), and ensure all my designs and builds are crafted with a careful eye. <br/><br/>
                
                In my free time, I love being outdoors and going on hikes, as well as diving into a good book. I also enjoy listening to sociology or true crime podcasts, or working on creating new coding projects! <br/><br/>
                
                Overall, I'm someone who is always looking to learn and grow, both personally and professionally. I believe in the importance of connecting with others and using my skills to make a positive impact in the world.<br/><br/>
                
                I'm always eager to meet new people and explore new opportunities. Don‚Äôt hesitate to connect and reach out!
